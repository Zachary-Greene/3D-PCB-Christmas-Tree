# 3D-PCB-Christmas-Tree
This is a repository for my 3D free standing PCB christmas tree project. It is two PCB's that slide together to create a free standing decoration. To secure the PCB's together, you solder them together using the exposed pads that ideally will line up. Included within the repository is a copy of this readme file, a license file and the eagle files.

## Parts and Assembly
### Assembly
Solder the smallest components on the boards first otherwise it'll be harder if you solder the bigger parts first. Then solder the larger components such as the battery holder. Afterwards, solder the two boards together with a strong connection, to prevent the solder from dripping down the board, put them on their sides so that they form a 'V' shape then solder.

### Parts
* ATtiny85 SOP Package x1
